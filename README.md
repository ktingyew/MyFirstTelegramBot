# MyFirstTelegramBot



There are 2 different telegram bots here.

1. `tutorial.telegram.py` is one that I followed from https://medium.com/python4you/creating-telegram-bot-and-deploying-it-on-heroku-471de1d96554. It doesn't do much. But it offers a tutorial on how to deploy onto Heroku server. So can refer to it. In addition, with the appropriate environment variables being set, you can configure if it's local or Heroku.

2. The other is `xkcdtelegram.py`. It only has one command: to return a random xkcd comic in the bot. This python file has a help file called `xkcdhelper.py`.
